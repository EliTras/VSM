# VSM - Volcanic and Seismic source Modelling
Volcanic and Seismic source Modelling (VSM) is an open source Python tool to perform geodetic data inversion.

Volcanic and Seismic source Modelling (VSM) is an open source Python tool to model ground deformation detected by satellite and terrestrial geodetic techniques. The VSM tool allows the user to choose one or more geometrical sources as forward model among sphere, spheroid, el-lipsoid, fault, and sill. It supports multiple datasets from most satellite and terrestrial geodetic techniques: interferometric SAR, GNSS, levelling, Electro-optical Distance Measuring, tiltmeters and strainmeters. Two sampling algorithms are available, one is a global optimization algorithm based on the Voronoi cells and the second follows a probabilistic approach to parameters estima-tion based on the Bayes theorem. VSM can be executed as Python script, in Jupyter Notebook environments or by its Graphical User Interface. Its broad applications range from high level re-search to teaching, from single studies to near real-time hazard estimates. Potential users range from early career scientists to experts. It is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/EliTras/VSM) and is accompanied by step-by-step documentation in Jupyter Notebooks. The paper presents the functionalities of VSM and test cases to describe its use and comparisons among possible settings.
