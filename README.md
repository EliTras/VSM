# Volcanic and Seismic source Modelling - VSM

Volcanic and Seismic source Modelling (VSM) is an open source Python tool to model ground deformation detected by satellite and terrestrial geodetic techniques.

Forward analytical models available and freely combinable
- isotropic point-source
- finite volume sphere
- spheroid
- ellipsoid
- fault/dike
- sill-like

Input datasets supported
- interferometric SAR
- GNSS
- levelling
- Electro-optical Distance Measuring
- tilt
- strain

Sampling algorithms
- Global optimization algorithm based on the Voronoi cells (Neighbourhood Algorithm - NA)
- Probabilistic approach to parameters estimation based on the Bayes theorem (Bayesian Inference - BI)

VSM can be executed as Python script, in Jupyter Notebook environments or by its Graphical User Interface.
Tests available at https://github.com/EliTras/VSM_test
