Volcanic and Seismic source Modelling (VSM) is an open source Python tool to model ground deformation detected by satellite and terrestrial geodetic techniques.

Forward analytical models available and freely combinable
- isotropic point-source
- finite volume sphere
- penny-shaped crack
- spheroid
- moment tensor
- rectangular dislocation

Input data supported
- interferometric SAR
- GNSS
- levelling
- electronic distance measurements
- tilt
- strain

Sampling algorithms
- global optimization algorithm based on the Voronoi cells (Neighbourhood Algorithm - NA)
- probabilistic approach to parameters estimation based on the Bayes theorem (Bayesian Inference - BI)

VSM can be executed as Python script, in Jupyter Notebook environments or by its Graphical User Interface.
Tests available at https://github.com/EliTras/VSM_test
Tests sill2NA and sill2BI include Jupyter Notebooks also.
